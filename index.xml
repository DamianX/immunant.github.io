      <description>Rustacean in Residence Systems programming is synonymous with coding in C/C++ at present. Immunant is exploring a new way to transition C code to newer systems programming languages such as Rust, Go, Nim, etc. We are looking for an additional team member &amp;amp; programming languages aficionado who loves to hack on compilers, language runtimes, and who believes that when machines finally become sentient, they will seek to eliminate their dependencies on libc before anything else.</description>

      <description>Immunant was founded to transition systems security research into practice. Our software has the potential to improve security for hundreds of millions of users without them ever noticing. Our tools change the way programs execute. Specifically, we alter the way code is compiled, linked, and loaded by the host OS. We are looking for an additional team member who is as excited about systems programming, compiler construction, information security research as we are.</description>
