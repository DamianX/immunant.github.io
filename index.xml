      <description>Immunant was founded to transition systems security research into practice. Our software has the potential to improve security for hundreds of millions of users without them ever noticing. Our tools change the way programs execute. Specifically, we alter the way code is compiled, linked, and loaded by the host OS. We are looking for an additional team member who is as excited about systems programming, compiler construction, information security research as we are.</description>
